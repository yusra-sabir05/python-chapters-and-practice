# arthematic operators

# 7 and 4 called operands
# + stand for operator 
# 11 called result 

# a = 9 
# b = 10 
# c = a + b 
# print(c) # output 19

# # = assignment operator 

# a = 4-3 
# print(a) # output 1
# b = 9
# b +=3  #increment
# print(b) # output 12
# b -=3 #decrement
# print(b) # output 9

# we can use multiplication and division also 

# comparision operators 

# d = 5 < 4
# print(d) # output False

# d = 5 > 4
# print(d) # output true

# d = 5 >= 5
# print(d) # output True
# d = 5 <= 5
# print(d) # output True

# d = 5 != 5
# print(d) # output False

# # logicl operators


e = True or False
print(e) # output True  = only one is true the answer is true 
e = True and False
print(e) # output false  =  both should be true then it return tru if one of them is false the answer is false 

# not operator

print(not(True))# not operator change the True thing into false and false thing into true
